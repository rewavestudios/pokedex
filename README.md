## üíª Install

Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (preferred way to manage Node.js versions in this Project).
Use the following cURL or Wget command:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

Check to make sure you've activated the correct version of node by typing:

```bash
node --version
# Prints: v22.15.0
```

If you get error `bash: /usr/bin/node: No such file or directory`, run this command to load `nvm` script:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check that the `nvm` command is recognized:

```bash
nvm --version
```

You should see a version number (like 0.40.3). Now that `nvm` is working, tell it to install and use the version specified in `.nvmrc`.
This command reads the `.nvmrc` file and installs the version it finds there:

```bash
nvm install
```

Check that the correct versino is active:

```bash
node --version
```
